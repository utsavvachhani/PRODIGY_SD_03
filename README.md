# PRODIGY_SD_03
internship task-3 at the Prodigy InfoTech.

- '**Implement a Simple Contact Management System**'
- Develop a program that allows users to store and manage contact information. The program should provide options to add a new contact by entering their name, phone number, and email address. It should also allow users to view their contact list, edit existing contacts, and delete contacts if needed. The program should store the contacts in memory or in a file for persistent storage.


  **Overview**
- This project is a Simple Contact Management System developed in Python, designed to store and manage personal and professional contacts efficiently. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, enabling users to easily add, view, edit, and delete contact information.


**Features**

  - **User-Friendly Interface:**
    - Developed using Tkinter to provide an intuitive and visually appealing GUI.
    - Users can easily interact with the application to manage their contacts.
      
  - Comprehensive CRUD Operations:
    - Add new contacts with details such as name, phone number, and email address.
    - View a list of all contacts with their details.
    - Edit existing contacts to update their information.
    - Delete contacts from the list.
      
  - Data Persistence:
    - Contact information is stored persistently using file handling techniques.
    - Data is saved to a file and retrieved upon application startup to ensure continuity.
  
  - Input Validation and Error Handling:
    - Validates user inputs to ensure accuracy and completeness of contact details.
    - Provides informative feedback for invalid inputs and operations to enhance user experience.


**Technologies Used**
  - Python:
    - Core programming language used for application logic and functionality.
  - Tkinter:
    - Python's standard GUI toolkit used to create the user interface
  - File Handling:
    - Used to save and retrieve contact data for persistent storage.


**How to Use**

  1. Clone the Repository:
  ```html
git clone https://github.com/utsavvachhani/contact-management-system.git
cd contact-management-system
  ```
  2. Run the Application:
  ```html
python contact_manager.py
  ```
  3. Use the Interface:
     - Add a Contact: Enter the contact details in the provided fields and click the "Add" button.
     - View Contacts: Click the "View Contacts" button to display the list of all contacts.
     - Edit a Contact: Select a contact from the list, modify the details, and click the "Update" button.
     - Delete a Contact: Select a contact from the list and click the "Delete" button.

**Example Usage**
- When the user starts the application, they can manage their contacts by adding new entries, viewing the list of contacts, editing existing entries, and deleting contacts as needed. The data is saved to a file for persistent storage and retrieved upon subsequent application launches.

**Project Structure**
```html
/PRODIGY_SD_03
    contact_manager.py
    README.md
```

**Future Enhancements**
- Add search and filter functionality to quickly find specific contacts.
- Implement additional fields for contact details (e.g., address, birthday).
- Enhance the GUI with more interactive elements and improved aesthetics.
